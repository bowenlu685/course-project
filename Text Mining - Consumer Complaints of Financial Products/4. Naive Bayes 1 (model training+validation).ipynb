'' her tactics to use me to deceptively obtain a loan she knew i would not afford has harmed me financially and emotionally . now , i have to find a place to live again ( i just moved in xxxx because of her lies and sold my house ) as not to disrupt my children as well as deal with a homeowner who was also financially harmed . all of the above events took place from xxxx xxxx until xxxx xxxx . additionally , caliber home loans serviced my previous home loan that another lender told me i should n't have received either because i did not qualify and they did not pay my taxes on that house . i did n't realize this until xxxx xxxx when a received a notice from xxxx county that they were putting a lien on my house for a tax sale . i had to pay those taxes out of my pocket because of the error . i still have n't been reimbursed for those fees either .\",\n",
