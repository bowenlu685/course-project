When I contacted  XXXX  about this, they said  FirstData  is a seperate entity and there is a termination fee, and that I signed a document regarding this. When I asked for a copy, they sent me two documents. the first was the supposed original agreement that I had signed. When compared to the original in my possession, there were multiple alterations, including my  Tax  ID, my form of business, an altered personal guaranty section, phone number section and hand written notes pertaining to schedule of payments and a note stating \" note ; lease dissolves when office sold \\'\\', which had been removed. The second document was completely fabricated using the first altered document, \" whiting out \\'\\' pertinent info and utilizing an  XXXX   (   XXXX   XXXX   ) I  use which has no customers, processes no cards and conducts no business. They then put in the bank account from the first business, altered the \" years in business \" section, altered the \" business type \\'\\' section, put in a fabricated billing address, including city and zip code, and expunged my handwritten notes, clearly utilizing the original altered agreement as a template to fabricate a second account  ( m ost likely to secure another sales commission in doing so. ) These fraudulent documents are then used  by FirstData  to establish a business relationship with the consumer/merchant and collect fees of various types.
